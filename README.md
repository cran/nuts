Changing administrative regional boundaries over time complicates the construction of consistent regional panel data. The `nuts` package can transform **European regional data** identified by **NUTS codes** between different **versions** and **subdivision levels** with the aim to harmonize and link data sets. 

The package's main task is to convert data between all NUTS versions in use: 2006, 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2021. These conversions can be performed in any direction based on **spatial interpolation** using five different weights (regional area in square kilometers, 2011 and 2018 population size, 2012 and 2018 built-up area). The weights are based on conversion tables provided by the [Joint Research Center (JRC) of the European Commission (EC)](https://urban.jrc.ec.europa.eu/tools/nuts-converter) that are used in their online converter. The `nuts` package permits to do the same conversion offline with additional advantages such as the conversion within groups, enabling the conversion of datasets with multiple NUTS versions efficiently.

### Installation

You can install the package from the rOpenSci repository:

``` r
install.packages("nuts", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")
```

### Usage

Check out the [website](https://docs.ropensci.org/nuts/articles/nuts.html) how to get started.

### Verbosity Control

Console messages can be controlled with `rlang::local_options(nuts.verbose = "quiet")` to silence messages and setting `nuts.verbose = "verbose"` to switch messages back on.
